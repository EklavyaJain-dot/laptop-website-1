     <div>A laptop (also laptop computer), is a small, portable personal 
computer (PC) with a "clamshell" form factor, typically having a thin
LCD or LED computer screen mounted on the inside of the upper lid of
the clamshell and an alphanumeric keyboard on the inside of the 
lower lid. The clamshell is opened up to use the computer. Laptops 
are folded shut for transportation, and thus are suitable for mobile use.
[1] Its name comes from lap, as it was deemed to be placed on a person's lap
when being used. Although originally there was a distinction between laptops
and notebooks (the former being bigger and heavier than the latter), as of 
2014, there is often no longer any difference. Today, laptops are commonly 
used in a variety of settings, such as at work, in education, for playing 
games, web browsing, for personal multimedia, and general home computer use.
